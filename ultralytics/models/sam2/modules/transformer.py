    An attention block that performs both self-attention and cross-attention in two directions: queries to keys and
    keys to queries. This block consists of four main layers: (1) self-attention on sparse inputs, (2) cross-attention
    of sparse inputs to dense inputs, (3) an MLP block on sparse inputs, and (4) cross-attention of dense inputs to
    sparse inputs.

    Attributes:
        self_attn (Attention): The self-attention layer for the queries.
        norm1 (nn.LayerNorm): Layer normalization following the first attention block.
        cross_attn_token_to_image (Attention): Cross-attention layer from queries to keys.
        norm2 (nn.LayerNorm): Layer normalization following the second attention block.
        mlp (MLP): MLP block that transforms the query embeddings.
        norm3 (nn.LayerNorm): Layer normalization following the MLP block.
        norm4 (nn.LayerNorm): Layer normalization following the third attention block.
        cross_attn_image_to_token (Attention): Cross-attention layer from keys to queries.
        skip_first_layer_pe (bool): Whether to skip the positional encoding in the first layer.
